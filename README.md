Neuretix
========

Neuretix is a spiking neural network simulation platform with extremely fast processing capabilities. Neuretix uses the Temportal Windowing algorithm, which increases the processing speed of spiking neural network processing by several orders of magnitude at any network activity levels.


The neuretix software contained in the project "CavalCade" is implemented in a test situation where the user can load pre-defined neural networks. The software also allows visualisation of the loaded neural networks.

The example networks are either encoded as genomes (in Genome folder) or as a plain neural network (Network folder)

This project is intended as a demonstration of the use of the CavalCade neural network libraries in order to visualise neural network systems. It also demonstrates the processing speed of the Temporal Window algorithms.

Currently the libraries only support neural networks with pre-defined parameters (learning algorithms such as STDP will be added at a later date, or by request)

Feel free to contact me on chris.bam4d@gmail.com to get more information on these libraries and how to run them.

The libraries are built using netbeans 7.1 on ubuntu linux 10.04

There are a few required libraries that need to be downloaded such as QT4 Framework, but these can be easily found on the ubuntu package manager.
